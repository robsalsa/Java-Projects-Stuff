# Java-Projects-Stuff
This is a bunch of NEWER java related projects

Note: To run these programs all you will need is some sort of IDE for this to run. Since these programs are all made in JAVA. An IDE that compiles (runs) JAVA code would be the best thing for this. I used Visual Studio Code (a light but multilingual IDE) but if you decide you'd like to use something else Eclipse IDE (Java) would be the next best thing, but you also do not want to download an IDE you can use an online comipler like Replit.
